In this project, I conducted a comprehensive analysis of factors influencing alumni giving rates in higher education institutions. Leveraging descriptive statistics and 
regression models, I explored the relationships between graduation rates, class sizes, student/faculty ratios, and alumni giving rates. The findings suggest a positive 
correlation between graduation rates and alumni giving, with smaller class sizes and lower student/faculty ratios contributing to higher graduation rates.

I proposed practical recommendations for executive management, emphasizing the importance of improving educational quality, optimizing class sizes, and maintaining an 
optimal student/faculty ratio. Additionally, I highlighted the potential impact of additional variables such as financial aid availability, alumni engagement activities, 
university reputation, and student demographics on alumni giving rates.

The analysis revealed that while none of the universities achieved substantially higher alumni giving rates than expected, all universities showed room for improvement in 
alumni engagement and fundraising efforts. The project aims to guide institutions in implementing targeted strategies to enhance alumni giving rates, ultimately 
contributing to increased revenue for higher education.
